/**
 * This component implements a parser to define terrains from a
 * graphical ASCII representation.
 * 
 * When mixing in that component, a level can be defined by
 * defining the field `level` in the following form:
 * 
 *   val level =
 *     """------
 *       |--ST--
 *       |--oo--
 *       |--oo--
 *       |------""".stripMargin
 * 
 * - The `-` character denotes parts which are outside the terrain
 * - `o` denotes fields which are part of the terrain
 * - `S` denotes the start position of the block (which is also considered
     inside the terrain)
 * - `T` denotes the final position of the block (which is also considered
     inside the terrain)
 * 
 * In this example, the first and last lines could be omitted, and
 * also the columns that consist of `-` characters only.
